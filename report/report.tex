\section{Introduction}
Dependent types have been succesfully applied to advanced type-based program
analysis, for example to prove safety properties of arrays, security protocols,
and prove compiler correctness.  The first paper is an early example of
application of dependent types.  The idea got developed further (among others)
by the second paper in the form of Logically Qualified Data Types or "Liquid
Types".  Finally, the third paper extends Liquid Types in the context of
Haskell Programming Language which uses lazy evaluation by default.



\section{Paper 1: Eliminating array bound checking through dependent types}

\abstract

Originating in type theory, dependent types is a powerful concept for extending
type checking for the purposes of program analysis. Its applications allow to
perform many advanced forms of analysis with a little work on the programmer's
side (providing correct type annotations). One of such applications is
elimination of array bound checking during the compilation time using dependent
types.

\subsection{Note on dependent types}

The concept of the dependent types is quite rich and well-studied, the main
idea behind it is that dependent type systems unlike systems with simple types
allow for types to depend on or vary with values. Examples to simple types are
products, functions or atomic types that are \texttt{int} or \texttt{bool}.

A classical example of a dependent type is a type of lists $List_\gamma(N)$ of
a given length $N : \mathbb{N}$ over some type $\gamma$. The elements of such
type are $Nil_\gamma : List(0)$ and $Cons_\gamma(x, l) : List(N+1)$, where $x :
\gamma$ and $l : List_\gamma(N)$. Now let's consider a function that takes $n :
\mathbb{N}$ and returns a list of length $n$ containing $0$ in all entries.
This function would have type $\Pi n : \mathbb{N}.List_\mathbb{N}(n)$, a type
of functions for which the type of the return value depends on the argument.
The important point of the dependent typing is that it reveals more information
about the function.

In the following no knowledge of the full theory of dependent types is assumed,
and furthermore, no such knowledge is required, as for the purpose of the paper
only a limited part of the dependent type systems is used. This part is fully
explained in the following sections. The limitation excludes terms of general
form (that possibly make type checking undecidable) from type formers and only
allows for a limited set of decidable refinements to be used.

However, some familiarity with the type theory notation and/or ML syntax
will be assumed.

For a full study on the dependent types the reader is referred to the following
paper \cite{Hofmann97syntaxand}.

\subsection{Introduction}
The problem of an absence of runtime array bound checking in lower level
languages, such as C has led to numerous problems over time. However, even in
the languages that perform this runtime checking, it still makes an issue
imposing additional execution time costs for every array access.  Moreover,
this issue is present not only for the imperative languages with array
accesses, but also for more general cases of accessing list elements through
pattern matching in strongly typed functional languages. Traditional compiler
optimizations for this analysis do not guarantee that they are always able to
infer the correct array bounds \cite{Gupta:1993}\cite{Suzuki:1977}.

On the other hand, approach that relies on the dependent types makes array
bounds checking a part of the type checking, with appropriate (albeit minor)
help from the programmer in form of more advanced type annotations. These
annotations construct a set of linear arithmetic value constraints which can be
efficiently checked for the satisfiability.

To give a practical validation to the  concept all examples are given in a
language that implements ML fragment extended with a limited form of dependent
types. This fragment matches the core language of ML standard, making omission
for exceptions and modules, which are not relevant to the issue by themselves,
and contains the addition of type annotations that cover the required
expressibility properties.

In the following, a value on which a dependent type is formed will be called an
\emph{index object}. For example, a type of integer lists in ML would be
written as follows: \texttt{int list}. To express a type of the integer lists
of length two one writes: \texttt{int list(2)}, where 2 is exactly the
\emph{index object}.  Then a function to append two integer lists of fixed
lengths \texttt{n} and \texttt{m} would have the type: \texttt{int(n) -> int(m)
-> int(n+m)}.

It is worth notice that if arbitrary terms can be used as index objects, then
type checking becomes undecidable, since it would involve arbitrary
computations.  Considering this, severe limitations on the index objects will
be imposed, distinguishing them from the general term of the implemented
language.

\subsection{Types and typing}

\subsubsection{The language of types}
This section presents a syntax for writing the index objects and forming the
type annotations in the implemented language.

Type indices may be integer or boolean expressions defined below.
$a$ ranges over the index variables.
\begin{align*}
  \text{Integer index } & i,j &&::= &&& a|i+j|i-j|i*j|div(i,j)\\
                &     &&    &&& |min(i,j)|max(i,j)\\
                &     &&    &&& |abs(i)|sign(i,j)|mod(i,j)\\
  \text{Boolean index } & b &&::= &&& a|false|true\\
                &     &&    &&& |i < j | i \leq j \\
                &     &&    &&& |i = j|i \geq j | i > j\\
                &     &&    &&& |\neg b| b_1 \land b_2 | b_1 \lor b_2\\
  \text{Index } & d &&::= &&& i|b
\end{align*}

$\delta$ ranges over base types or \emph{basic type families}, that may be built-in
(\texttt{int}, \texttt{array}) or user-declared. $\alpha$ stands for type variables.
\begin{align*}
  \text{Index sort } & \gamma &&::= &&& int | bool | \{ a: \gamma | b \}\\
  \text{Types } & \tau &&::= &&& \alpha | (\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n)\delta (d_1, \dots, d_k) | \{ a: \gamma | b \}\\
                &      &&    &&& | \tau_1 * \dots * \tau_n | \tau_1 \to \tau_2\\
                &      &&    &&& | \Pi a: \gamma. \tau | \Sigma a: \gamma. \tau
\end{align*}

For clarity, the type constructor with no arguments or indices is written
simply as $\delta$ (instead of $()\delta()$).

Notation $\{ a: \gamma | b \}$ denotes those elements of $\gamma$ that satisfy
the boolean constraints $b$.  $nat$ serves as an abbreviation for $\{ a: int |
a \geq 0 \}$. The types $\Pi a: \gamma. \tau$ and $\Sigma a: \gamma. \tau$
denote universal and existential quantification of $a$ respectively.

In the examples, implementation language uses uses \texttt{\{a:g\} t} for $\Pi
a: \gamma. \tau$ and \texttt{[a:g] t} for $\Sigma a: \gamma. \tau$. One can
also write \texttt{\{a:g | b\} t} for $\Pi a: \{a: \gamma | b\}. \tau$.

\subsubsection{Built-in type families}

The examined ML fragment extension includes type families for integers, arrays
and booleans as built-in.

\begin{itemize}
  \item For every integer $n$, \texttt{int(n)} is a singleton type containing
    only $n$.
  \item \texttt{bool(true)} and \texttt{bool(false)} are singleton types for
    \texttt{true} and \texttt{false} respectively.
  \item For a natural number $n$, \texttt{'a array(n)} is the type for arrays
    of size $n$ over a type \texttt{'a}

    One can also omit indices in type specification, in that case they will
    interpreted existentially. For instance, the type \texttt{int array} will
    be converted to $\Sigma n : nat$.\texttt{int array}$(n)$, which can be read
    as an array of an unknown size $n$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Datatype refinements}

As in ML standard, besides having such types as \texttt{int}, \texttt{bool} and
\texttt{array}, users can declare their own types with the usual construct.
Consider a declaration of a list type:
\begin{verbatim}
datatype 'a list =
  nil
| :: of 'a * 'a list
\end{verbatim}

There's then a possibility to refine this declaration with type indices:
\begin{verbatim}
typeref 'a list of nat
with nil <| 'a list(0)
| :: <| {n:nat} 'a * 'a list(n) -> 'a list(n+1)
\end{verbatim}

And this refinement forms a dependent type for lists with the list size exposed
in the type, that was discussed earlier.

\subsubsection{Example functions}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The dot product function},label=dotprod,captionpos=t,float,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
assert length <| {n:nat} 'a array(n) -> int(n)
and sub <| {n:nat} {i:nat | i < n} 'a array(n) * int(i) -> 'a

fun dotprod(v1, v2) =
  let
    fun loop(i, n, sum) =
      if i = n then sum
      else loop(i+1, n, sum + sub(v1, i) * sub(v2, i))
    where loop <| {n:nat} {i:nat | i <= n}
      int(i) * int(n) * int -> int
  in
    loop(0, length v1, 0)
  end
where dotprod <| {p:nat} {q:nat | p <= q }
  int array(p) * int array(q) -> int
\end{lstlisting}

To introduce the language, Figure \ref{dotprod} shows an example of a function
calculating the dot product of two vectors organized as arrays.

The example illustrates the use of the dependent types in the language, where
dependent types are given after the \texttt{where} keyword. It's worth notice
that if one decides to omit the lines containing \texttt{where} from the
function code, the function can be accepted by any compiler adhering to the ML
standard. Predefined function \texttt{length} returns the length of a given
array and \texttt{sub} returns an element at the specified position. Note that
the type declaration of \texttt{sub} ensures that the array access is always
within the array bounds and therefore avoids the need for the runtime bound
checking. The same use of the dependent types is applied to \texttt{loop} and
\texttt{dotprod} type declarations.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The reverse function for lists},label=reverse,captionpos=t,float,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
fun reverse(l) =
let
  fun rev(nil, ys) = ys
    | rev(x::xs, ys) = rev(xs, x::ys)
  where rev <| {m:nat} {n:nat}
    'a list(m) * 'a list(n) -> 'a list(m+n)
in
  rev(l, nil)
end
where reverse <| {n:nat} 'a list(n) -> 'a list(n)
\end{lstlisting}

Another example on Figure \ref{reverse} illustrates a function computing the
reverse of a given list. The type here ensures that the size of the list
doesn't change from the argument to the result.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The filter function for lists},label=filter,captionpos=t,float,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
fun filter p nil = nil
  | filter p (x::xs) =
    if p(x) then x::(filter p xs)
    else filter p xs
where filter <| {m: nat}
  ('a -> bool) -> 'a list(m) -> [n:nat | n <= m] 'a list(n)
\end{lstlisting}

Figure \ref{filter} depicts a function that makes use of existentially
quantified dependent types. This function removes all elements from the list
$l$ which do not satisfy the predicate $p$. Obviously, for an arbitrary $p$,
it's impossible to give an exact value of the resulting list size without
computing the function. Therefore this value cannot be accepted as a function
argument, but still can have a specific bound, that is -- the size of the
resulting list should not be greater than the size of the initial list.
\texttt{[n:nat | n <= m] 'a list(n)} expresses exactly this, yielding a list of
some definitive size, which is bound by a fixed number.

More details to the language and example programs can be found in
\cite{Xi:1998}\cite{XiPhd:1998}.

\subsection{Constraints}

The given definition of dependent types leads to a formation of constraints on
the values used in the program, where constraints are boolean index expressions
enriched with explicit quantifiers and implication.

The language for constrains is as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \text{Constraints } &\phi &&::= &&&b | \phi_1 \land \phi_2 | b \supset \phi\\
                      &     &&    &&&| \exists a : \gamma. \phi | \forall a : \gamma. \phi
\end{align*}

Constraints are extracted from the program after it has been type checked
ignoring dependent types and verified correct by the ML type inference.

\subsubsection{Constraint generation}

Consider the \texttt{rev} function from the Figure \ref{reverse}:
\begin{verbatim}
fun rev(nil, ys) = ys
  | rev(x::xs, ys) = rev(xs, x::ys)
where rev <| {m:nat} {n:nat}
  'a list(m) * 'a list(n) -> 'a list(m+n)
\end{verbatim}

For the first case of \texttt{rev}, namely \texttt{rev(nil, ys) = ys} the two
variables $M$ and $N$ are generated according to the index objects of the
function type.  Then \texttt{nil} is checked against the type \texttt{'a
list($M$)} and \texttt{ys} is checked against the type \texttt{'a list($N$)}.

This generates constraints $M = 0$ and $N = \texttt{n}$, where \texttt{ys} is
assumed to be of type \texttt{'a list(n)}. Afterwards, the type of the right
hand side of the pattern matching clause, \texttt{ys}, is checked against
\texttt{'a list($M$ + $N$)}, the result type for \texttt{rev}. This yields a
constraint $M + N = \texttt{n}$.

Thus, the first clause of the pattern matching in the function definition
generates the constraint:

$\forall n : nat. \exists M : nat. \exists N : nat. (M = 0 \land N = n \supset M + N = n)$

This is simplified by the elimination of the existential variables to:

$\forall n : nat. (0 + n = n)$

which is stored and easily verified on the later stages.

Applying the same procedure to the second case in the definition,
\texttt{rev(x::xs, ys) = rev(xs, x::ys)} provides the following constraint:

$\forall m : nat. \forall n : nat.(m + 1) + n = m + (n + 1)$,

that can also be satisfied.

\subsubsection{Constraint solving}

The reader may notice, that constraints obtained by the given syntactic rules
generate a set of linear integer arithmetic equations and thus can be solved by
any LIA solver. For the purpose, many various methods exists, such as
Fourirer-Motzkin, Simplex, SUP-INF, etc.

Applying these methods to the set of constrains will ensure that type checking
on dependent types passes if and only if the constrains are satisfiable by the
solving procedure.

\subsubsection{Experiments}

The computational experiments with the programs written using this bound
checking elimination technique show a stable performance gain (10-70\%) among
the studied programs. The associated code changes (type annotations) are
considerably insignificant in size compared to the overall size of the program.

The exact implementation and experimental details are found in \cite{Xi:1998}.

\subsection{Related work}

The original paper became the influential example of a practical dependent
types application for the purposes of static analysis. The ideas got
implemented in form of DML dialect of ML \cite{XiPhd:1998} and inspired further
developments in refinement types.



\section{Paper 2: Liquid Types}

\subsection{Introduction}

Rondon et al. introduced Logically Qualified Data Types or short Liquid Types in~\cite{Rondon:2008:LT}.
Liquid types are dependent types and thus one can express types like $i:: \{\nu:$ \lstinline{int} $\mid 0 \le \nu \land \nu < 100\}$.
If one thinks of $i$ as an index of an array with 100 elements the type ensures that one can safely access the array at index $i$.
The advantage of liquid types is that those types can be infered automatically.
The inference is done in 3 steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Step 1 performs a standard Hindley-Milner (HM) type inference.
        The obtained types are transformed into templates where the unknown type refinements are expressed by so called liquid type variables.
    \item Step 2 generates a set of subtype constraints which restrict choices for the liquid type variables.
        This step is guided by the syntax.
    \item Step 3 tries to solve these constraints by embedding them into a decidable logic.
\end{enumerate}

To describe the refinements of liquid types we take a set of predicates (qualifiers) over program variables, a special variable $\nu$ and a placeholder $\star$ for program variables.
To illustrade this we choose $\mathbb{Q} = \{ 0 \le \nu, \star \le \nu, \nu < \star, \nu <$ \lstinline{len} $\star\}$.
The set $\mathbb{Q}^\star$ contains all qualifiers which are obtained by choosing a qualifier from $\mathbb{Q}$ and replace the $\star$-s by program variables.
So $0 \le \nu, x \le \nu, \nu < n$ and $\nu <$ \lstinline{len} $a$ are contained in $\mathbb{Q}^\star$.
By taking conjunctions of qualifiers from $\mathbb{Q}^\star$ we get refinements of liquid types.
We use some abbreviations.
A type $B$ is short for $\{\nu: B \mid true\}$.
We write $\kappa$ for $\{\nu: B \mid \kappa\}$ with a liquid type variable $\kappa$ and $\{e\}$ for $\{\nu: B \mid e\}$ with a predicate $e$ if the type $B$ is clear from the context.

\subsection{Examples}
\label{subsec:exmpl}

In this subsection several properties of liquid types are shown using examples.
Each example illustrates how liquid types interact with a given language feature.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example Program},label=lst:exmpl,captionpos=t,float,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
let max x y =
    if x > y then x else y

let rec sum k =
    if k < 0 then 0 else
        let s = sum (k - 1)
        in s + k

let foldn n b f =
    let rec loop i c =
        if i < n then loop (i + 1) (f i c) else c
    in loop 0 b

let arraymax a =
    let am l m = max (sub a l) m
    in foldn (len a) 0 am
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Path Sensitivity}

We will show that the function \lstinline{max} in Listing~\ref{lst:exmpl} returns a value which is greater or equal to both arguments.
In step 1 HM yields the type $x:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow y:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow$ \lstinline{int} for \lstinline{max}.
Using this type we build the template $x: \kappa_x \rightarrow y: \kappa_y \rightarrow \kappa_1$.
The liquid type variables $\kappa_x, \kappa_y, \kappa_1$ are the unknown refinements for the arguments $x$ and $y$ plus the body of \lstinline{max}.
Step 2 generates the following constraints since the body is an \lstinline{if}-expression:
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:max}
    x: \kappa_x; y: \kappa_y; (x > y) \vdash \{\nu = x \} <: \kappa_1\\
    x: \kappa_x; y: \kappa_y; \neg(x > y) \vdash \{\nu = y \} <: \kappa_1
\end{align}
The first constraint forces the type of the \lstinline{then}-branch (namely $\{\nu = x \}$) to be a subtype of the body ($\kappa_1$) in the environment where $x$ and $y$ have the appropriate types as well as the branch condition is true.
The second contraint is analogous.
Note that in the environment the branch condition is false.
So path sensitivity is introduced by adding assumptions to the environment.
In step 3 we set $\kappa_x$ and $\kappa_y$ to true because \lstinline{max} can be called by any integer.
Moreover we use a theorem prover to get the strongest conjunction of qualifiers in $\mathbb{Q}^\star$ for $\kappa_1$ which staisfies the two constraints.
We get $x \le \nu \land y \le \nu$ since if $x > y \land \nu = x$ then $x \le \nu \land y \le \nu$ and if $\neg(x > y) \land \nu = y$ then $x \le \nu \land y \le \nu$.
Thus we obtain the type:
\begin{center}
    \lstinline{max} :: $x:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow y:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow \{\nu:$ \lstinline{int} $\mid x \le \nu \land y \le \nu\}$.
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Recursion}

Now we show that the recursive function \lstinline{sum} from Listing~\ref{lst:exmpl} returns a non-negative integer not less than the argument $k$.
HM in step 1 yields $k:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow y:$ \lstinline{int}.
We obtain the template $k: \kappa_k \rightarrow \kappa_2$, where $\kappa_k$ is the refinement for $k$ and $\kappa_2$ the refinement for the body of \lstinline{sum}.
As the body is again an \lstinline{if}-expression we generate two constraints in step 2.
Let us consider the \lstinline{then}-branch first:
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:sum-then}
    \text{\lstinline|sum|}: k: \kappa_k \rightarrow \kappa_2; k: \kappa_k; k < 0 \vdash \{\nu = 0\} <: \kappa_2
\end{align}
Like in the case for \lstinline{max} we added the branch condition to the environment.
Also we added the type of \lstinline{sum} to the environment since the function is recursive.
For the \lstinline{else}-branch we first look at the recursive call.
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:s}
    \text{\lstinline|sum|}: k: \kappa_k \rightarrow \kappa_2; k: \kappa_k; \neg(k < 0) \vdash \{\nu = k - 1\} <: \kappa_k
\end{align}
This constraint forces the argument $k - 1$ for the call of \lstinline{sum} to be a member of the yet unknown type of the argument.
For the variable $s$ we have to replace the paramater $k$ in $\kappa_2$ by the actual argument $k - 1$ of this call.
So we get:
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:sum-in}
    \text{\lstinline|sum|}: k: \kappa_k \rightarrow \kappa_2; k: \kappa_k; \neg(k < 0); s: [k-1/k]\kappa_2 \vdash \{\nu = s + k\} <: \kappa_2
\end{align}
Step 3 searches for the strongest conjunction of qualifiers for $\kappa_k$ and $\kappa_2$.
If we look at constraint~(\ref{algn:s}) we must set $\kappa_k$ to true since $k - 1$ can be negative, zero or positive.
For $\kappa_2$ we use $0 \le \nu \land k \le \nu$.
We observe that constraint~(\ref{algn:sum-then}) is trivially satisfied.
The binding for $s$ in the constraint~(\ref{algn:sum-in}) simplifies to $s: 0 \le \nu \land k - 1 \le \nu$.
So we have to show that $\neg(k < 0) \land 0 \le s \land k - 1 \le s \land \nu = s + k$ implies $0 \le \nu \land k \le \nu$.
The statement is valid since $k$ and $s$ are both non-negative.
The essential point of this example is that recursion is introduce through the variable $s$ which stores the result of the recursive call.
Overall we get:
\begin{center}
    \lstinline{sum} :: $k:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow \{\nu:$ \lstinline{int} $\mid 0 \le \nu \land k \land \nu \}$
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Higher-Order Functions}
As an example for a higher-order function we look at \lstinline{foldn} (Listing~\ref{lst:exmpl}).
We want to show that the first argument of $f$ is always between $0$ and $n$.
In step 1 we first get the polymorphic type for \lstinline{foldn}
$\forall \alpha.\,n:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow b: \alpha \rightarrow f:($ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha$.
This yields the template
$\forall \alpha.\,n: \kappa_n \rightarrow b: \alpha \rightarrow f:(\kappa_3 \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha$.
For \lstinline{loop} we get the template $i: \kappa_i \rightarrow c: \alpha \rightarrow \alpha$.
In step 2 we examine the two interesting cases for \lstinline{loop}:
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:loop-i}
    \dots; i: \kappa_i; i < n \vdash \{\nu = i + 1 \} <: \kappa_i
\end{align}
This constraint ensures that the argument $i + 1$ to \lstinline{loop} is a member of the argument type $\kappa_i$.
Similarly the second constraint forces the argument $i$ to be of the type $\kappa_3$ of the first argument of \lstinline{f}.
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:f}
    \dots; i: \kappa_i; i < n \vdash \{\nu = i \} <: \kappa_3
\end{align}
For the call of \lstinline{loop 0} we obtain
\begin{align}
    \label{algn:loop-0}
    \dots \vdash \{\nu = 0 \} <: \kappa_i
\end{align}
which ensures that $0$ is a member of $\kappa_i$.
In step 3 $\kappa_n$ is assigned to true since we can call \lstinline{foldn} with any $n$.
For $\kappa_i$ we obtain $0 \le \nu$ which trivially satisfies constraints~(\ref{algn:loop-i}) and (\ref{algn:loop-0}).
By plugging this in constraint~(\ref{algn:f}) we get $0 \le \nu \land \nu < n$ for $\kappa_3$.
All in all we have:
\begin{center}
    \lstinline{foldn} :: $\forall \alpha.\,n:$ \lstinline{int} $\rightarrow b: \alpha \rightarrow f:(\{0 \le \nu \land \nu < n\} \rightarrow \alpha \rightarrow \alpha) \rightarrow \alpha$
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Polymorhism and Array Bounds Checking}

We assume a type \lstinline{intarray} of arrays over integers and a function \lstinline{len} which yields the number of elements in the array.
The array access function \lstinline{sub} has the type
$a:$ \lstinline{intarray} $\rightarrow j: \{\nu:$ \lstinline{int} $\mid 0 \le \nu \land \nu < $ \lstinline{len} $a\} \rightarrow$ \lstinline{int}.
The function \lstinline{arraymax} from Listing~(\ref{lst:exmpl}) uses the above functions to determine the maximum of 0 and the elements of an array.
We show that the array access is safe and that \lstinline{arraymax} returns a value greater or equal to 0.
Step 1 produces the templates $a:$ \lstinline{intarray} $\rightarrow \kappa_4$ for \lstinline{arraymax} and $l: \kappa_l \rightarrow m: \kappa_m \rightarrow \kappa_5$ for \lstinline{am}.
Additionally we get $\kappa_6$ as instantiation for $\alpha$ in the template of \lstinline{foldn}.
Step 2 generates for \lstinline{sub l a}:
\begin{align}
    l: \kappa_l; m: \kappa_m \vdash \{\nu = l\} <: \{0 \le \nu \land \nu < \text{\lstinline|len| } a\}
\end{align}
For \lstinline{max (sub l a) m} we get which constraints the body type of \lstinline{am}:
\begin{align}
    l: \kappa_l; m: \kappa_m \vdash \{\text{\lstinline|sub l a|} \le \nu \land m \le \nu \} <: \kappa_5
\end{align}
We obtain for \lstinline{foldn (len a) 0}:
\begin{align}
    \dots \vdash \{ \nu = 0 \} <: \kappa_6
\end{align}
For \lstinline{foldn (len a) 0 am} we have:
\begin{align}
    \dots \vdash l: \kappa_l \rightarrow m: \kappa_m \rightarrow \kappa_5 <: \{0 \le \nu \land \nu < \text{\lstinline|len| } a\} \rightarrow \kappa_5 \rightarrow \kappa_6
\end{align}
This constraint reduces to
\begin{align}
    & \dots \vdash \{0 \le \nu \land \nu < \text{\lstinline|len| } a\} <: \kappa_l \\
    & \dots \vdash \kappa_6 <: \kappa_m \\
    & \dots \vdash \kappa_5 <: \kappa_6
\end{align}
We ensure that the body type of the \lstinline{foldn} is a subtype of the body type of \lstinline{arraymax} by
\begin{align}
    \dots \vdash \kappa_6 <: \kappa_4
\end{align}
Step 3 uses for $\kappa_m, \kappa_4, \kappa_5$ and $\kappa_6$ the qualifier $0 \le \nu$.
$\kappa_l$ is assigned to $0 \le \nu \land \nu < \text{\lstinline|len| } a$.
Therefore we obtain:
\begin{center}
    \lstinline{arraymax} :: \lstinline{intarray} $\rightarrow \{ \nu:$ \lstinline{int} $\mid 0 \le \nu \}$
\end{center}



\subsection{Liquid Type Checking}

The liquid type checking is formalized in a $\lambda$-calculus with \lstinline{if}- and \lstinline{let}-expressions, recursive funtions and polymorphism.
Intuitively a liquid type $T$ is well-formed under the environment $\Gamma$ ($\Gamma \vdash T$) if the free variables occuring in the refinements of $T$ are bound in $\Gamma$.
The environment $\Gamma$ consists of type bindings ($x: T$) and predicates.
For example we can say that $\{\nu:$ \lstinline{int} $\mid x \le \nu \land y \le \nu$ is well-formed under $x:$ \lstinline{int}; $y:$ \lstinline{int}.
In addition there is also a decidable subtype judgment $\Gamma \vdash T_1 <: T2$ stating that $T_1$ is a subtype of $T_2$ under environment $\Gamma$.
As example consider $x:$ \lstinline{int}; $y:$ \lstinline{int}; $(x > y) \vdash \{\nu = x \} <: x \le \nu \land y \le \nu$
The liquid type judgement $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}} e: T$ says that the expression $e$ has type $T$ under environment $\Gamma$ if one considers the logical qualifiers $\mathbb{Q}$.
For example we can show $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}}$ \lstinline{let} $s$ \lstinline{= sum (k - 1) in s + k} $: T$ if $T$ is well-formed under $\Gamma$ and the refinements of $T$ consists of conjunctions over logical qualifiers in $\mathbb{Q}^\star$, plus
$\Gamma \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}}$ \lstinline{sum (k - 1)} $:T_1$ and $\Gamma; x: T_1 \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}}$ \lstinline{s + k} $: T$.
Soundness of this liquid type checking is proven in two steps.
Firstly, one defines an exact type system $\Gamma \vdash e: T$ using an undecidable subtype judgment.
Then soundness is obtained using the following theorems, where $\succ$ is the single evaluation step relation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \label{thm:sound}
    \item (Overapproximation) If $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}} e: T$ then $\Gamma \vdash e: T$.
    \item (Preservation) If $\Gamma \vdash e: T$ and $e \succ e'$ then $\Gamma \vdash e': T$.
    \item (Progress) If $\emptyset \vdash e: T$ and $e$ is not a value then $\exists e'. e \succ e'$.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Liquid Type Inference}

The 3 steps of the type inference can be implemented in the formal setting.
The examples given in Subsection~\ref{subsec:exmpl} illustrate some cases of this algorithm.
Also for this algorithm called \lstinline{Infer}($\Gamma, e, \mathbb{Q}$) one can show some theorems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \lstinline{Infer}($\Gamma, e, \mathbb{Q}$) terminates.
    \item If \lstinline{Infer}$(\Gamma, e, \mathbb{Q} = T$ then $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}} e: T$.
    \item If \lstinline{Infer}($\Gamma, e, \mathbb{Q}$) returns no type then $\nexists T.\, \Gamma \vdash_{\mathbb{Q}} e: T$.
\end{enumerate}

Combining these with the theorems~\ref{thm:sound} we obtain that if \lstinline{Infer}$(\emptyset, e, \mathbb{Q} = T$ then the evalution of $e$ won't get stuck.

\subsection{Experiments}

In order to assess the advantage of this approach liquid type inference is implemented in \textbf{DSolve}.
It is tested over a set of benchmarks from the \textbf{DML} project~\cite{Xi:1998:EAB}.
To allow array bounds checking the qualifiers are of the form $\nu \bowtie X$ where $\bowtie \in \{<, \le, =, \neq, \geq, >\}$ and $X \in \{0, \star,$ \lstinline{len} $\star$\}.
In most cases \textbf{DSolve} can prove the safety of array accesses without additional annotations i.e. qualifiers.
If qualifiers are missing the infered types help to identify which ones should be added.
Compared to the \textbf{DML} project the impact is very big.
Whereas in the \textbf{DML} project 17\% of all lines (31\% of characters) are annotations \textbf{DSolve} only needs 1\% of lines and characters.



\section{Paper 3: Refinement Types in Haskell}

\subsection{Introduction and Motivating Examples}
\subsubsection{Refinement Types, Briefly}
Refinement types, as the name suggests, refine types with predicates to encode
values that can inhabit these types.  For example,
\begin{lstlisting}[abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    type Pos = { v:Int | v >  0 }
    type Nat = { v:Int | v >= 0 }
\end{lstlisting}
describe positive and non-negative integers, respectively.  We can then encode
\emph{pre-} and \emph{post-}conditions for functions using these refined types,
for example
\begin{lstlisting}[language=haskell,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    div :: n:Nat -> d:Pos -> { v:Nat | v < n } 
    (+) :: x:Int -> y:Int -> { v:Int | v = x + y }
\end{lstlisting}
which \emph{requires} (for example) that the inputs of \texttt{div} are
respectively non-negative and positive, and \emph{ensures} that the output of
\texttt{div} is less than the first input \texttt{n}.

\subsubsection{Standard Refinement Types: From Subtyping to VC}
Consider programs in Listing~\ref{list:good-bad}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Simple Example},float,captionpos=t,label={list:good-bad},language=haskell,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    good :: Nat-> Nat -> Int
    good x y = let z = y + 1 in x `div` z

    bad :: Nat -> Nat -> Int
    bad x y = x `div` y
\end{lstlisting}
To anaylize \texttt{bad}, the refinement type system will create a subtyping
query for the second argument to \texttt{div},
\begin{align*}
    x:\{x\geq0\}, y:\{y\geq0\}\vdash\{v\geq0\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
which will get translated into the following \emph{verification condition}
(VC),
\begin{align*}
    (x\geq0)\wedge(y\geq0)\implies(v\geq0)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}
which a SMT solvers will reject as invalid.  Thus a refinement system will
reject \texttt{bad}.

On the other hand, the refinement system will accept \texttt{good}.  The
corresponding subtyping query is
\begin{align*}
    x:\{x>0\}, y:\{y\geq0\},z:\{z=y+1\}\vdash\{v=y+1\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
which reduces to a valid VC
\begin{align*}
    (x\geq0)\wedge(y\geq0)\wedge(z=y+1)\implies(v=y+1)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Lazy Evaluation Makes VCs Unsound}
Consider Listing~\ref{list:counter}.  
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Lazy evaluation breaks VC},float,captionpos=t,label={list:counter},language=haskell,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    diverge :: Int -> { v:Nat | false } 
    diverge n = diverge n

    explode :: Int -> Int
    explode x = let { n = diverge 1; y = 0 }
                 in x `div` y
\end{lstlisting}
Under lazy evaluation, it will result in division by zero (but not under eager
evaluation).  To see why, consider that the refinement type system will check
that \texttt{y} has type \texttt{Pos} at the call to \texttt{div}, i.e.
\begin{align*}
    n:\{\mathtt{false}\},y:\{y=0\}\vdash\{v=0\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
which reduces to VC
\begin{align*}
    \mathtt{false}\wedge(y=0)\implies(v=0)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}
which is valid because of contradiction in the antecedent.  Under eager
evaluation, this is a sound VC; \texttt{div} never gets executed since
\texttt{diverge} doesn't terminate i.e. doesn't produce a value (the
\texttt{false} in the type signature of \texttt{diverge} basically tells this).
Under lazy evaluation, since the result of \texttt{n} is not needed,
\texttt{diverge} will not be computed thus resulting in a division by zero and
making the VC unsound.

\subsubsection{Solutions, Challenges, and Key Idea}
There are two natural solutions to the above problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only consider variables which are guaranteed to have values e.g.
        those under pattern matching, \texttt{seq}, or strictness annotations.
        This approach is sound but imprecise.
    \item Reason \emph{explicitly} about diverging terms within the refinement
        logic.  Unfortunately, while this approach is sound and precise, it is
        not clear how to use the existing SMT machinery to do this.
\end{itemize}
The paper proposes a method to reason \emph{implicitly} about divergence using
stratified type system.


\subsection{Verification With Stratified Types}
\subsubsection{Implicit Reasoning: Lazy Evaluation}
Formally, the aforementioned type system is \emph{stratified} into types which
are inhabited by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Potentially diverging terms, called Div-type and written as $\tau$.
    \item Terms that are guaranteed to reduce into Haskell values in WHNF (Weak
        Head Normal Form), in finite steps.  These terms are said to have
        Wnf-types (written as $\tau^{\downarrow}$).  Note that Wnf-type can
        contain infinite values e.g. list with infinite length such as
        \texttt{0 : repeat 0}.
    \item Terms that reduce into finite values, called Fin-type and written as
        $\tau^{\Downarrow}$.
\end{itemize}
The key idea here is that if a variable may diverge (i.e. with type that
belongs to Div types), the constraint for it is omitted in the VC.  Formally,
let $B$ be a basic labelled type.  Then it will be translated into VC as
follows:
\begin{align}
    (|x:\{v:B|r\}|)=
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            \texttt{true}&\mbox{if }B\mbox{ is a Div type}\\
            r[x/v]&\mbox{otherwise}
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{VC and Partial Correctness}
The preceeding refinement type system retain the Hoare notion of "partial
correctness", which means that if a function terminates, then its pre- and
post-conditions hold.  Thus it can verify programs where all terms are of Div
types.  The following example illustrates this point.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Partial Correctness},float,captionpos=t,label={list:partial-correctness},language=haskell,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    example :: Int -> Int
    example n = let x = collatz n in 10 `div` x

    collatz :: Int -> { v:Int | v = 1 }
    collatz n
        | n == 1    = 1
        | even n    = collatz (n / 2)
        | otherwise = collatz (3*n + 1)
\end{lstlisting}

It is unclear whether \texttt{collatz} terminates, but we know that its output
is a Div \texttt{Int} with value equal to $1$.  Thus we have the subtyping
query
\begin{align*}
    x:\{v:Int|v=1\}\vdash\{v=1\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
yielding the valid VC
\begin{align*}
    \mathtt{true}\implies(v=1)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}
thereby verifying \texttt{example}.

\subsubsection{Improving Precision by Forcing Evaluation}
If all the terms have Div types then the verifier cannot make any assumption
about the context in which a term evaluates.  This leads to a drastic loss of
precision.  Consider the call to \texttt{div} in
Listing~\ref{list:loss-of-precision}, which obviously safe, but the system
would reject it as it yiels the subtyping query
\begin{align*}
    x:\{x:Int|v=1\},y:\{y:Int|y>x\}\vdash\{v>x\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
and invalid VC
\begin{align*}
    \mathtt{true}\implies(v>x)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}
since \texttt{x} is a Div type.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Loss of Precision},float,captionpos=t,label={list:loss-of-precision},language=haskell,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    ex = let { x = 1; y = inc x } in 10 `div` y

    inc :: z:Int -> { v:Int | v > z }
    inc = \z -> z + 1
\end{lstlisting}

This problem can be solved by forcing the evaluation of \texttt{x}, either by
\texttt{seq} or the strictness annotation, thus changing the previous subtyping
query
\begin{align*}
    x:\{x:Int^{\downarrow}|v=1\},y:\{y:Int|y>x\}\vdash\{v>x\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
and valid VC
\begin{align*}
    (x=1)\implies(v>x)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}
which the system would gladly verify.

\subsubsection{Improving Precision by Termination}
While the forcing evaluation leads to better precision, it requires program
rewriting which could be cumbersome.  Another approach is to use a termination
analysis to aggresively assign terminating expressions Fin types.  Returning to
Listing~\ref{list:loss-of-precision}, since term \texttt{1} obviously
terminates, we can type \texttt{x} as $Int^{\Downarrow}$, which yiels the
subtyping query
\begin{align*}
    x:\{x:Int^{\Downarrow}|v=1\},y:\{y:Int|y>x\}\vdash\{v>x\}\preceq\{v>0\}
\end{align*}
and valid VC
\begin{align*}
    (x=1)\implies(v>x)\implies(v>0)
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Verifying Termination With Refinements}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Verifying Termination},float,captionpos=t,label={list:termination-check},language=haskell,abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    ex2 = let { x = fun 9; y = inc x } in 10 `div` y

    fun :: Nat -> { v:Int | v = 1 }
    fun n = if n == 0 then 1 else f (n-1)
\end{lstlisting}
How to verify termination for recursive functions?  One approach is to show
that each recursive call is made with arguments of a strictly smaller size,
where size itself is a well-founded metric such as natural numbers.  For
example, the system typecheck the body of \texttt{fun} in
Listing~\ref{list:termination-check} inside environtment
\begin{align*}
    x:Nat^{\Downarrow}, \mathtt{fun}:\{n':Nat^{\Downarrow}|n'<n\}\rightarrow\{v=1\}
\end{align*}
where the type of \texttt{fun} is weaken to stipulate that it only be
recursively called with \texttt{Nat} values $n'$ that are strictly less than
the current parameter $n$.  This generates the valid VC
\begin{align*}
    (0\leq n)\wedge\neg(0=n)\implies(v=n-1)\implies(0\leq v<n)
\end{align*}

Since (potentially) non-terminating variables can appear in the refinement $r$,
we exclude diverging refinements from types.  In particular, a refinement type
$\{v:B|r\}$ if well formed if and only if $r$ has type $Bool^{\Downarrow}$

\subsubsection{Measures}
To describe properties of algebraic data types, the paper uses \emph{measures}
instead of integer and boolean expressions.  For example, the measure
\texttt{emp}
\begin{lstlisting}[abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    measure emp :: [Int] -> Bool
        emp []      = true
        emp (x:xs)  = false 
\end{lstlisting}
checks whether a list of \texttt{Int}s is empty.  As shown here, a measure
consists of a set of equations with simple pattern on the left hand side.  On
the other hand, the right hand sides contain refinement expressions $r$.  With
the above definition of \texttt{emp}, it is straightforward to show that
\begin{align*}
    \mathtt{[1,2,3]}::\{v:\mathtt{[Int]}|\mathtt{not (emp v)}\}
\end{align*}

How to reason about measures in the context of refinement types?  One approach
that is both precise and efficient is by translating each equation in a measure
into refined types for the corresponding data constructor.  Thus for list and
the \texttt{emp} measure, we have
\begin{lstlisting}[abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    []  :: { v:[Int] | emp v = true }
    :   :: x:Int -> xs:[Int] -> { v:[Int] | emp v = false } 
\end{lstlisting}
This way, each time a list value is constructed, its type carries over its
emptiness information.  Furthermore, each time a list value is pattern-matched,
its emptiness information can be used to improve precision.

Finally, if a type has multiple measures, it is refined with the conjunction of
each measures.  For example, the \texttt{len} measure can be used to compute
the length of a list
\begin{lstlisting}[abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    measure len :: [Int] -> Int
        len []      = 0
        len (x:xs)  = 1 + len xs 
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    []  :: { v:[Int] | len v = 0 }
    :   :: x:Int -> xs:[Int] -> { v:[Int] | len v = 1 + (len xs) } 
\end{lstlisting}
Thus the final type for list data constructors will be as follows.
\begin{lstlisting}[abovecaptionskip=-\medskipamount]
    []  :: { v:[Int] | emp v = true && len v = 0 }
    :   :: x:Int -> xs:[Int] -> 
           { v:[Int] | emp v = false && len v = 1 + (len xs) } 
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Conclusions}
This paper made two important contributions.  First, it shows that the standard
techniques to generate VCs from refinement subtyping queries is unsound under
lazy evaluation.  Second, it presented a solution that addresses the
unsoundness by using a stratified type system which consists of types that are
inhabited by potentially diverging terms, types that must reduce to a Haskell
value, and types that must reduce to a finite value.  

While the approach presented in the paper works well in practice, the authors
admitted that from theoretical point of view, it felt unsatisfying since it
relies critically on proving termination.  It felt unsatisfying since adding
divergence shouldn't break a safety proof.  Nevertheless, the solution
presented in the paper are constrained by current available two-valued logic SMT
machinery; improvements might need a three-valued logic SMT to explicitly
handle divergence and thus will rely less on proving terminations.
